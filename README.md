# Service Worker Sample - Built for Wordpress
I built this service worker for our Wordpress site TechNutty.

This is just a sample of how you could implement Service Worker into your site, you would need to change aspects of it to work with your own site.

In order to get it working you will need to link to the service worker fle from your project in the service_worker_reg.js file, and then add a link to the reg file in the footer of your project.
